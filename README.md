# React Native Unhandled Network Request Error

This example demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: insufficient error handling during asynchronous operations, specifically network requests.  The `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data but lacks robust error handling, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The solution provided demonstrates best practices for handling network errors and gracefully managing the component's state during loading and error scenarios.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the behavior when the network request fails (e.g., by intentionally causing a network error or using an invalid API endpoint).  The original code might just hang. The improved code will display an error message.
